      There are three tables in the database an author table has a first name, a
      last name and an email address. A publisher table has a name, a street
      address, a city, a state/ province, a country, and a Web site. A book
      table has a title and a publication date. It also has one or more authors
      (a many-to-many relationship with authors) and a single publisher (a
      one-to-many relationship - aka foreign key - to publishers). Design a form
      which populates and retrieves the information from the above database
      using Django.
