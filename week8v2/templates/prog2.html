      Consider the following tables: WORKS(person-name,Company-name,Salary)
      LIVES(Person_name, Street, City) Assume Table data suitably. Design a
      Django webpage and include an option to insert data into WORKS table by
      accepting data from the user using TextBoxes. Also, include an option to
      retrieve the names of people who work for a particular company along with
      the cities they live in (particular company name must be accepted from the
      user).
