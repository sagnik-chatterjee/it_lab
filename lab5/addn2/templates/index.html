        A Thousand Splendid Suns is a 2007 novel by Afghan-American author
        Khaled Hosseini, following his bestselling 2003 debut The Kite Runner.
        Mariam, an illegitimate teenager from Herat, is forced to marry a
        shoemaker from Kabul after a family tragedy. Laila, born a generation
        later, lives a relatively privileged life, but her life intersects with
        Mariam's when a similar tragedy forces her to accept a marriage proposal
        from Mariam's husband. Hosseini has remarked that he regards the novel
        as a "mother-daughter story" in contrast to The Kite Runner, which he
        considers a "father-son story".[1] It continues some of the themes used
        in his previous work, such as familial dynamics, but instead focusing
        primarily on female characters and their roles in contemporary Afghan
        society. A Thousand Splendid Suns was released on May 22, 2007,[2] and
        received favorable widespread critical acclaim from Kirkus Reviews,[3]
        Publishers Weekly,[4] Library Journal,[5] and Booklist,[6] and became a
        number one New York Times Best Seller for fifteen weeks following its
        release.[7] During its first week on sale, it sold over one million
        copies.[8] Columbia Pictures purchased film rights in 2007, and a
        theatrical adaptation of the book premiered on February 1, 2017, at the
        American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California.[9
